# WordMaze
## About
A simple app to visualize and enable playing around with word embeddings.
Word embeddings are vectors learnt by language models to represent words, expressions.
These vectors often have linear properties, so we can add and subtract different meanings.
For example, with if you take the France's representation vector, subtract Paris and add Tokyo, you get
a vector close to Japan (France-Paris+Tokyoâ‰ˆJapan).

This app makes it easy to play around with embeddings, and see what other words you can build out of word vectors.
